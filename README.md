# Terrynini's Game
This is a final project programmed by me for computer practicum in NCU, TW(2016)</br>
I try to follow the MVC, but it still become a mishmash</br>
There are tons of bugs, but I don't have time to fix them</br>
This is not a good game, because there is nothing for player to accomplish</br>

## Play the game
You can download the game from realese
https://github.com/terrynini/Terrynini-s-Game/releases

## How to play
B: Open backpack (B to cancel)</br>
Z: Drink heal potion</br>
X: Drink mana potion</br>
M: Show mini map</br>
Space: Attack</br>
Enter: Enter Game

## Feature
The map is generated by a simple maze generation algorithm which implemented by me, so the map would change every time.
